# Project-4

CODE REVIEW

Design: The product was designed for web using so the design files are in html style. For each graph we get, we need to set up parameters like center location, zoom factor, color for each feature, view mode, and radius. In the density example, we make the graph of density of cars in one city.

Complexity: Since all our modules are designed for web user, so it is very efficient to implement by using just any browser.

Comment: The sample code that we found really has a great comment way. It is easy to find the parameters we need to define and give value. Also, the functions that the code try to accomplish are also described clearly in the comments.

Testing: We test two cases for the AMAP API, one is to get the density of car for one city in China, the other is to calculate average incomes of different provinces in China and graph them.

Style: The codes are designed in html and java script, which is easy to implement and efficient to run and test.

Error Handling: Although some warning has been set, the API stuck sometimes if the connection to server of AMAP are not stable enough. But I personally think downloading some local packages about maps may help.
